# ALX Airbnb Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the complete backend documentation for the ALX Airbnb Clone project. The objective is to analyze, design, and document the system architecture and backend logic of an Airbnb-like application. The documentation includes feature definitions, use case modeling, user stories, data flow analysis, process flowcharts, and backend requirement specifications.

## Project Goals

- Understand the features and behaviors of a real-world booking platform.
- Model user interactions and backend workflows.
- Visualize system components through diagrams.
- Document technical requirements for backend implementation.

## Directory Structure

- `features-and-functionalities/`  
  Contains a markdown file and PNG diagram describing the core backend features the system must support.

- `use-case-diagram/`  
  Includes a use case diagram (PNG) showing how users interact with the system across various operations.

- `user-stories/`  
  Contains a markdown file with detailed user stories derived from the use case diagram.

- `data-flow-diagram/`  
  Stores a data flow diagram (PNG) showing how data moves through the system between users, processes, and storage.

- `flowcharts/`  
  Includes a flowchart diagram (PNG) visualizing the step-by-step workflow of a selected backend process (e.g., booking or registration).

- `requirements.md`  
  A comprehensive document listing technical and functional specifications for major backend features.
